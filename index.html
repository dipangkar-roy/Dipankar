 <h1 class="on">A Liar Cowboy</h1>

  <p>

There lived a cowboy in a certain village. He grazed the cattle in the field near the forest. He used to cut grasses, wash away the cattle and feed them. Besides his usual duty he sang, played flute and gossiped with other boys. The boy had a bad habit. At times he shouted saying ‘tiger, tiger, help me, save me’. People used to come running towards him hearing his shouting. He got pleased with this. One day at afternoon, he was grazing in the field. Suddenly, he really saw a tiger. He became afraid and shouted saying ‘tiger’ again and again. But nobody came to save him. He tried to climb up a tree, but failed. The tiger attacked very swiftly and killed him. When people found his dead body, they had nothing to do. I think that sometimes we ourselves create the tragedy in our life. Same thing happened in the cowboy’s life. If he didn’t tell a lie shouting ‘tiger’ before, people would come running and perhaps he might avoid the danger. So we should not tell a lie even for making a fun.</p>
